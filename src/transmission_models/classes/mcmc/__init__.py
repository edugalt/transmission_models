"""
MCMC Module.

This module contains Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms for
transmission network inference.

Main Classes
------------
MCMC : Main MCMC sampler class for transmission tree inference

The MCMC module provides methods for sampling from the posterior distribution
of transmission trees using various proposal mechanisms including:
- Tree topology changes (rewiring)
- Adding/removing unsampled hosts
- Infection time updates
